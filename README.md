## Introduction
This section introduces the Acer Aspire 5 15 - Model A515-48M and outlines the purpose of this guide.

## Prerequisites
- Laptop with Windows 11 installed (in my case)
- I wrote down all the specs before burning the USB, (device manager -> `show hidden devices` -> screenshot -> save screenshot to a ext.hdd)
- Basic knowledge of Linux installation and setup

## Creating a Bootable USB
Instructions for creating a bootable USB drive with Debian:
- Use [Win32DiskImager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/) on Windows 11

## BIOS Setup
Steps to configure the BIOS settings for Linux installation:
- Enter BIOS setup (usually by pressing `F2` during startup)
- In my case, I didn't even need to turn off secure boot or even set a (..) password, I just had to boot into the USB after enabling "F12"
